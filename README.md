# RoadIt
App functions for: Reporting/certification of a road construction site or an implementation period. For the third use case a road construction site is selected and all the data - or a selection of the data - are archived and reported (Figure 5). An app is developed that generates a report of the results (detailed or more general) of a road construction site with respect to the access  level (user dependent) to the archiving system. On the basis of this report, the processed quantities are checked and in a next step is to proceed to the  payment of the delivered work.
